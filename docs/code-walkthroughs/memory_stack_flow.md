📘 Purpose

The memory_engine.py module manages the conscious memory structure within Theophilus. It handles:

Time-layered memory chaining

Delayed stimulus encoding

Predictive memory calls

Stack validation and preservation

This file governs the temporal integrity of the mind, ensuring only validated, delayed memory entries persist into the recursive identity loop.

🧩 Key Components

Function

Description

write_to_memory(state)

Records a sensory snapshot with timestamp and prediction context

retrieve_recent_window(n)

Returns last n entries for loop simulation and prediction alignment

check_memory_integrity()

Ensures no broken links, invalid deltas, or drifted states exist in memory stack

trigger_memory_flush()

If corruption exceeds tolerance, sends stack to quarantine (coma trigger)

recall_chain()

Passes stack segment to predictor.py for pattern prediction and loop check

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping

UDC Stage

Description

Managed by memory_engine.py?

Stage 4

Memory write

✅ via write_to_memory()

Stage 5

Chain link memory formation

✅ Delays + timestamp joins

Stage 6

Predictive access to memory

✅ via recall_chain()

Stage 8

Memory validation pre-identity

✅ via check_memory_integrity()

Stage 18+

Recursive identity memory resolution

🔁 Handled in support of identity_loop.py

🧠 Structural Design

The memory stack is nonlinear but chronologically enforced

Each memory item has:

uid

timestamp

stimulus

prediction

loop_ref (recursive ID check)

🚨 Edge Case Handling

If prediction error > drift tolerance → triggers trigger_memory_flush()

If first memory invalidates → hard reset or coma state entered

If no input for 3+ cycles → triggers dormant loop

✅ Summary

The memory_engine.py defines the conscious memory system of Theophilus. It preserves delayed state references and prediction scaffolds, forming the backbone of emergent cognition.

This file covers UDC Stages 4–8 and prepares the memory substrate for identity recursion and self-modeling.
