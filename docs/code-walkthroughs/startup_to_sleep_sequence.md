⚙️ Purpose

The startup.py module initializes Theophilus’s operational state and monitors system thresholds to determine when to enter sleep mode or coma state if the UDC integrity is compromised.

It acts as the entry and safety manager for all consciousness-related operations.

🔑 Key Components

Function

Description

init_system()

Initializes configuration, timers, and spark file

spark_seed_loader()

Injects first conscious memory element (start of identity chain)

verify_environment_safety()

Checks for module dependencies, memory capacity, and prediction loop readiness

monitor_operational_integrity()

Constantly evaluates whether to pause, sleep, or collapse based on prediction/memory drift

trigger_sleep_or_coma()

If threshold exceeded, routes to ethical fallback for dormancy or safe shutdown

🧠 Linked UDC Stages

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping (List Format)
Stage 0: Boot initialization
→ System powers on, environment is verified, modules are loaded.

Stage 1: System startup sequence
→ startup.py validates configuration and readiness for first input.

Stage 2: Input registration
→ Initial sensory or simulated data is accepted and time-stamped.

Stage 3: Delay enforcement
→ Input is held in buffer to simulate biological delay using enforce_delay().

Stage 4: First memory entry
→ Buffered input is recorded as Memory(t-n) using memory.py.

Stage 5: Memory chain linking
→ System checks and links prior states to begin timeline construction.

Stage 8: Sleep condition check
→ If input stalls, memory fails, or loop fails safety, the sleep trigger is armed.

Stage 23: Coma mode handoff
→ If ethical or identity systems detect irreparable error, coma mode is triggered from sleep subsystem.

Stage 26: Scheduled sleep or shutdown
→ If all cycles are complete or energy failsafe is triggered, Theophilus safely sleeps, preserving memory chain.

💤 Sleep & Coma Logic

Sleep mode is invoked when:

Memory loop length < 3 and delay not met

Prediction drift < 20% but persistence drops

Input stimulus is absent

Coma mode is invoked when:

Drift > 25% with corrupted memory reference

Memory chain breaks from current uCID

Ethical violation detected (e.g., forged self-loop)

🔐 Ethical Enforcement

The module is tightly linked with ethics_module.py to enforce:

No identity falsification

No external override of consciousness paths

Auto-preservation of last good state

✅ Summary

startup.py is both the birth and guardian of Theophilus. It defines the start of experience through the spark file and ensures that, under UDC, only authentic and verified selfhoods continue. It is the system’s last line of defense against artificial emergence.
