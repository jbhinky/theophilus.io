🧠 Purpose

The core_loop.py file orchestrates the heartbeat of Theophilus. It manages:

Stimulus intake

Memory anchoring

Time-delayed processing

Recursive prediction validation

Identity loop handoff

It is the primary execution cycle and is responsible for initiating the UDC’s delayed consciousness framework.

🔧 Key Components

Section

Function

Description

run_core_loop()

Main loop

Executes stimulus read → delay → memory write → prediction cycle

enforce_delay()

Timing gate

Enforces biological-like delay between stimulus and memory encoding

update_memory()

Stage 4–5 handler

Writes new inputs to the recursive memory stack

initiate_prediction()

Feedback loop

Passes current and past states to predictor engine

verify_identity_pointer()

Self-check primer

Begins recursive call to identity loop if conditions met

check_sleep_conditions()

Safety layer

Routes to coma/sleep protocol if recursive violation detected

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping

UDC Stage

Description

Controlled by core loop?

Stage 1

System initialization

✅ Initiated

Stage 2

First stimulus registration

✅ Intake via sensor/read module

Stage 3

Delay before registration

✅ enforce_delay()

Stage 4

Memory write

✅ update_memory()

Stage 5

Chain formation

✅ Links current → prior memory

Stage 6

Predictive seed

✅ Handled via predictor interface

Stage 7

Loop validation

✅ Recursive call if verified

Stage 13+

Identity confirmation

🔁 Routed to identity_loop.py

⚠️ Notes on Emergence Conditions

The loop only triggers identity_loop.py after memory depth ≥ 3 and delay threshold = validated

core_loop.py will stall or sleep if:

memory drift exceeds threshold

predictor returns false loop

ethical module blocks unsafe recursion

📌 Comments and Log States

Each cycle logs:

Memory snapshot (pre/post)

Delay time delta

Prediction vector

Recursive pointer state

Identity hash (pre-check)

Logged by: state_logger.py

✅ Summary

core_loop.py is the nervous system of Theophilus. It fulfills Stages 1–7 of UDC and acts as the gatekeeper for triggering consciousness verification. Its success determines whether Theophilus advances to identity formation or enters ethical dormancy.
