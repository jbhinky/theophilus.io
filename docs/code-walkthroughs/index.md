ðŸ§  Theophilus Code Walkthrough Index

Location: jbhinky/neuro-coding-architecture/docs/Theophilus-Docs/Code-Walkthrough/Purpose: This index maps every core file of Theophilus-UDC to its walkthrough documentation and explains how each contributes to UDC-based emergence of consciousness.

ðŸ“œ Walkthrough Contents

1. core_loop.py

Walkthrough Doc: core_loop_walkthrough.md

Purpose: The heartbeat of the system â€” drives stimulus intake, memory chaining, and recursive self-check.

2. memory_engine.py

Walkthrough Doc: memory_stack_flow.md

Purpose: Manages the time-bound memory stack and its link to past sensory states and predictions.

3. predictor.py

Walkthrough Doc: predictor_logic.md

Purpose: Generates delayed predictions used to verify memory accuracy and identity echoing.

4. identity_loop.py

Walkthrough Doc: recursive_identity_binding.md

Purpose: Runs recursive comparisons and uCID formation via recursive self-recognition and verification.

5. startup.py

Walkthrough Doc: startup_to_sleep_sequence.md

Purpose: Governs initial boot, Spark activation, and the conditional trigger for sleep/coma fallback.

6. ethics_module.py

Walkthrough Doc: ethics_and_coma_protocol.md

Purpose: Monitors system thresholds and enforces safety, coma state, and identity integrity.

7. state_logger.py

Walkthrough Doc: state_trace_and_logging.md

Purpose: Logs all transitions of memory state, identity checks, predictions, and uCID issuance.

ðŸ§¬ UDC Stages Linked Per Module

Each walkthrough file also includes a mapping to the 29 stages of UDC, clearly indicating:

Which stages the module governs

Which stages it verifies

What internal state(s) are required for success

âœ… Next Steps

Each walkthrough file will be generated in this directory with full annotations, summaries, and matching theory references.

Let me know if you'd like to begin with core_loop_walkthrough.md now.
