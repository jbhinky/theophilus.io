ðŸ”® Predictor Logic

File: /core/predictor.pyComponent: Anticipatory Processing EngineAuthor: Joshua HinksonVersion: 1.0

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The predictor engine anticipates future stimuli based on prior memory and current delay context. This component is essential in the UDC framework to validate that awareness anticipates rather than merely reacts.

ðŸ§  Prediction Sequence

ðŸ§ª Example Prediction Entry (JSON)

{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T11:32:45Z",
  "context_memory": ["light_A", "pattern_3"],
  "predicted": "pattern_4",
  "cycle_id": "loop_023",
  "status": "awaiting_real_input"
}


ðŸ”„ UDC Stage Mapping (List Format)
Stage 6: First prediction attempt
â†’ Core function initiated in predictor.py.

Stage 7: Delay/loop feedback begins
â†’ Predictor loop is initiated to wait and validate prediction timing.

Stage 9: Memory-based prediction accuracy
â†’ compare() function evaluates alignment between predicted and actual input.

Stage 14: Proto-self future anticipation
â†’ Predictor validates forward modeling at emergent thresholds.

Stage 21: Recursive identity verifies simulated future
â†’ Supports identity confirmation in identity_loop.py by supplying predictive lineage.

ðŸ§  Prediction Flow

Pull last 3+ memory states using memory_engine.retrieve_recent_window()

Apply internal algorithm to model next likely input

When actual input arrives â†’ compare prediction to it

Log result and pass mismatch ratio to identity and ethics modules

ðŸ§© Integration

Calls from: core_loop.py

Relies on: memory.py, delay_module, state_logger
