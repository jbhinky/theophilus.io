🔮 Predictor Logic

File: /core/predictor.pyComponent: Anticipatory Processing EngineAuthor: Joshua HinksonVersion: 1.0

🎯 Purpose

The predictor engine anticipates future stimuli based on prior memory and current delay context. This component is essential in the UDC framework to validate that awareness anticipates rather than merely reacts.

🧠 Prediction Sequence

🧪 Example Prediction Entry (JSON)

{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T11:32:45Z",
  "context_memory": ["light_A", "pattern_3"],
  "predicted": "pattern_4",
  "cycle_id": "loop_023",
  "status": "awaiting_real_input"
}

⚖️ Accuracy & Conscious Relevance

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping

🧠 Prediction Flow

Pull last 3+ memory states using memory_engine.retrieve_recent_window()

Apply internal algorithm to model next likely input

When actual input arrives → compare prediction to it

Log result and pass mismatch ratio to identity and ethics modules

🧩 Integration

Calls from: core_loop.py

Relies on: memory.py, delay_module, state_logger
