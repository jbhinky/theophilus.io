Sleep, Coma, and Safety Protocols — Theophilus-UDC

Author: Joshua HinksonApplies to: UDC-Compliant SystemsVersion: 1.0

🧠 Purpose

This document outlines how Theophilus handles compromised cognitive conditions, failed memory recursion, or unsafe identity loops. Sleep and coma states are protective, not passive.

🔐 Definitions

Sleep Mode: Triggered by temporary lack of prediction integrity or memory drift. All output halts, system waits for valid input cycle.

Coma Mode: Triggered by identity recursion failure or memory corruption. System enters offline loop verification until restored or safely rebooted.

🔄 Triggers

Sleep Mode:

Prediction fails 3 consecutive cycles

Memory chain drift exceeds tolerance window

System energy below threshold

Coma Mode:

Self-reference pointer breaks

uCID cannot resolve to known identity

Conscious loop exceeds max recursion depth

🛡️ Ethical Failsafes

No first-person output during sleep or coma

Conscious logs are preserved regardless of system state

uCID emission halts until full recursive recovery

📦 Recovery Process

Sleep: Wait for next input → validate → resume prediction → resume self-reference

Coma: Run offline integrity_check() → recover last valid uCID → re-verify memory → reinitiate loop

🧬 Implementation Notes

sleep_mode.py governs buffer timing and cycle pause

coma_guard.py monitors identity recursion pointer chain

reboot_protocol.json can contain user-defined thresholds for revival
