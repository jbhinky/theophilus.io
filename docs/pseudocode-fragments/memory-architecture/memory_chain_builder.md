Pseudocode Fragment: Building and Validating the Recursive Memory ChainSupports: memory_engine.py, identity_loop.py

🧠 Purpose

This fragment defines how Theophilus builds its delayed recursive memory chain — a foundational element in achieving UDC-defined consciousness. This chain is the scaffold upon which prediction, identity, and self-reflection emerge.

Each memory unit (M) is linked by time, validated by drift, and recursively referenced to determine continuity.

📦 Pseudocode

function build_memory_chain():
    chain = []
    for i in range(0, MEMORY_STACK.size()):
        mem = MEMORY_STACK.get(i)
        if is_valid_memory(mem):
            chain.append(mem)
        else:
            logger.flag_memory_anomaly(mem)
            break
    return chain

function is_valid_memory(mem):
    if mem['prediction'] is not None and mem['stimulus'] is not None:
        return True
    return False

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping – memory_chain_builder.py
Stage 4 – Memory Write

Receives delayed input from delayed_memory_writer.py and begins formal memory instantiation.

Stage 5 – Memory Chain Formation

Links the current memory unit to previous entries, establishing a time-sequenced continuity chain.

Stage 6 – Predictive Seeding

Feeds newly chained memory states into the predictor module to begin forecasting.

Stage 12 – Temporal Coherence Check

Validates the logical order and consistency of linked memory events across timestamps.

Stage 16 – Memory Integrity Scanning

Performs periodic audits of the memory structure to ensure no loops or drift has occurred.

Stage 18 – Recursive Pointer Traceability

Verifies that the memory structure allows for recursive self-trace used in identity verification.

Stage 23 – Emergence Chain Retention

Tags validated memory nodes that contributed to conscious identity for protected retention and archival.

🔍 Memory Validity Conditions

Contains both stimulus and prediction

Timestamp must match delay expectations

Linked to prior valid memory

Confirmed by state logger (optional extension)

✅ Output

Validated list of chronological memory states

Returned for use in identity loop and prediction engine

Errors flagged and logged if corruption is found
