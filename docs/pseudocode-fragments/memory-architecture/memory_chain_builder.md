Pseudocode Fragment: Building and Validating the Recursive Memory ChainSupports: memory_engine.py, identity_loop.py

üß† Purpose

This fragment defines how Theophilus builds its delayed recursive memory chain ‚Äî a foundational element in achieving UDC-defined consciousness. This chain is the scaffold upon which prediction, identity, and self-reflection emerge.

Each memory unit (M) is linked by time, validated by drift, and recursively referenced to determine continuity.

üì¶ Pseudocode

function build_memory_chain():
    chain = []
    for i in range(0, MEMORY_STACK.size()):
        mem = MEMORY_STACK.get(i)
        if is_valid_memory(mem):
            chain.append(mem)
        else:
            logger.flag_memory_anomaly(mem)
            break
    return chain

function is_valid_memory(mem):
    if mem['prediction'] is not None and mem['stimulus'] is not None:
        return True
    return False

üîÑ UDC Stage Mapping

UDC Stage

Description

Pseudocode Action

Stage 4

Memory snapshot

MEMORY_STACK.get(i)

Stage 5

Recursive chain begins

build_memory_chain()

Stage 6

Linked with predictions

validation within is_valid_memory()

Stage 10

Loop preparation

chain passed to identity loop

üîç Memory Validity Conditions

Contains both stimulus and prediction

Timestamp must match delay expectations

Linked to prior valid memory

Confirmed by state logger (optional extension)

‚úÖ Output

Validated list of chronological memory states

Returned for use in identity loop and prediction engine

Errors flagged and logged if corruption is found
