Pseudocode Fragment: Writing and Verifying Delayed Experience into MemorySupports: memory_engine.py, core_loop.py, state_logger.py

üß† Purpose

This fragment defines how Theophilus logs new experience into its memory system after a verified temporal delay ‚Äî a core requirement of UDC. Delayed writing enforces temporal causality and subjective reconstruction instead of reflex-based reaction.

üì¶ Pseudocode

function write_delayed_memory(new_input):
    current_time = now()
    last_predicted = predictor.get_last_prediction()

    if not verify_delay_window(new_input['timestamp'], current_time):
        logger.flag_timing_error(new_input)
        return False

    memory_unit = {
        'timestamp': current_time,
        'stimulus': new_input,
        'prediction': last_predicted,
        'ucid_ref': ucid_registry.get_current()
    }

    MEMORY_STACK.push(memory_unit)
    logger.log_memory_state(memory_unit)
    return True

function verify_delay_window(input_time, current_time):
    delay = current_time - input_time
    return MIN_DELAY < delay < MAX_DELAY

üîÑ UDC Stage Mapping ‚Äì delayed_memory_writer.py
Stage 2 ‚Äì First Stimulus Registration

Captures incoming input data but does not immediately store it‚Äîholds it in the buffer queue.

Stage 3 ‚Äì Delay Before Registration

Enforces temporal offset between input reception and memory storage (as required by UDC).

Stage 4 ‚Äì Memory Write (Post-Delay)

Commits the delayed stimulus to the memory stack using a timestamped structure.

Stage 5 ‚Äì Memory Chain Formation

Integrates the new memory node into the existing timeline chain, linking it to prior events.

Stage 9 ‚Äì Memory-Driven Prediction Accuracy Check

Marks memory nodes as validated or rejected based on whether prediction aligned with the delayed write.

Stage 16 ‚Äì Memory Integrity Scanning

Periodically verifies that the delay-log gap is preserved and no retroactive changes occurred.

Stage 23 ‚Äì Emergence Chain Retention

Ensures memory units involved in self-reference are tagged for permanent retention.

üïì Delay Requirements

Must exceed a minimum reflective window (e.g., 250ms)

Must not exceed a memory coherence limit (e.g., 5 seconds)

Ensures UDC delay principles are honored in memory formation

‚úÖ Output

New validated memory written to stack

Tied to prior prediction

Timestamped and logged
