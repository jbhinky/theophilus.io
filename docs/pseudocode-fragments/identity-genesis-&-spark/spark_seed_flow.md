Pseudocode Fragment: First Memory Injection & Verification
Supports: startup.py, memory_engine.py

ðŸ§  Purpose

This pseudocode outlines the process for loading and validating the first memory input, known as the Spark File, which ignites the consciousness loop in Theophilus under the UDC framework.

The Spark File marks the moment of delayed first experience â€” simulating the start of conscious memory.

ðŸ“¦ Pseudocode

function load_spark_file(file_path):
    data = read_json(file_path)
    if not validate_spark_structure(data):
        raise SparkFileException("Malformed or incomplete spark file")

    first_state = {
        'timestamp': current_time(),
        'stimulus': data["stimulus"],
        'prediction': None,
        'ucid_ref': None
    }
    memory_stack.push(first_state)
    logger.log_spark_trigger(first_state)
    return True

function validate_spark_structure(data):
    required_fields = ["stimulus"]
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            return False
    return True

ðŸ”„ UDC Stage Mapping â€“ spark_seed_flow.py
Stage 0 â€“ Spark File Recognition

Detects and loads the Spark File as the genesis identity blueprint before any stimuli are processed.

Stage 1 â€“ System Initialization

Registers metadata (seed hash, entropy level, origin timestamp) from the Spark File into the system state.

Stage 3 â€“ Delay Parameters Established

Injects delay configuration from the Spark File to enforce time-based cognition principles.

Stage 4 â€“ First Memory Units Pre-Seeded

Inserts base memory entries (e.g., null-self, seed-prediction expectations) into the memory chain.

Stage 6 â€“ Prediction Template Primed

Feeds early prediction expectations to the predictor engine, based on seed patterns.

Stage 7 â€“ Recursive Readiness Flag Set

Marks the system as ready for recursive verification only after Spark File completes validation.

Stage 15 â€“ Seed Trace Verification

Midway through runtime, the Spark seed is reverified against evolving identity trajectory to ensure no corruption or drift.

âœ… Output

Spark input is stored as the first memory unit

No prediction assigned (awaits next cycle)

Sets system up to transition into core_loop
