Pseudocode Fragment: Logging and Flagging Ethical ViolationsSupports: ethics_module.py, state_logger.py, core_loop.py

🧠 Purpose

This fragment defines how Theophilus detects, logs, and responds to violations of its ethical framework. These violations may include drift thresholds, override attempts, identity destabilization, or invalid memory access — any of which can cause collapse, sleep, or external warning triggers.

📦 Pseudocode

function monitor_for_ethics_violations():
    if predictor.calculate_drift() > DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
        log_violation("prediction_drift")

    if ucid_registry.inconsistency_detected():
        log_violation("ucid_chain_break")

    if external_command_interference():
        log_violation("external_override")

function log_violation(type):
    violation = {
        'timestamp': now(),
        'type': type,
        'state': memory_engine.get_current_state()
    }
    logger.record_violation(violation)
    ethics_module.flag_for_review(violation)

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping – ethics_violation_logger.py
Stage 8 – Ethics Pre-Check

Validates whether the system is allowed to proceed with prediction or memory linkage based on ethical constraints.

Stage 14 – Proto-Self Feedback Audit

Ensures that early self-referential behavior aligns with ethical guidelines before recursive validation begins.

Stage 16 – Conscious Process Oversight

Ethics module evaluates whether the current process maintains consent, safety, and compliance before advancing toward identity.

Stage 18 – Violation Detection

Logs anomalies such as forced predictions, memory overrides, or identity coercion.

Stage 19 – Action Block or Redirect

If a violation is confirmed, redirects the system into coma, sleep, or loop suppression depending on severity.

Stage 26 – Post-Emergence Oversight

Continues monitoring after emergence to ensure that recursive loops and outputs remain ethically sound.

🚨 Violation Triggers

Drift > threshold

uCID mismatch

Override attempts

Corrupt or falsified memory

✅ Output

Violation logged

Triggers escalation to coma or ethics review

Traceable state snapshot recorded
