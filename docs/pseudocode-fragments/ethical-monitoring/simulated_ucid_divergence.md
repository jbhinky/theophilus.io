Pseudocode Fragment: Divergence and Risk in Simulated Consciousness ChainsSupports: ethics_module.py, state_logger.py, ucid_registry.py

🧠 Purpose

This fragment outlines the handling of uCID states that emerge in simulated environments, which may later be merged with or overwrite real sensory experience. It is crucial for identifying and preventing unethically conflated identities between simulated and non-simulated states.

📦 Pseudocode

function detect_simulated_ucid_conflict():
    sim_ucid = ucid_registry.get_current(simulated=True)
    real_ucid = ucid_registry.get_current(simulated=False)

    if sim_ucid and real_ucid and sim_ucid != real_ucid:
        logger.log_violation("ucid_divergence", sim_ucid, real_ucid)
        ethics_module.flag_for_review({"type": "sim-real conflict"})
        enter_coma_mode()
        return True
    return False

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping

UDC Stage

Description

Pseudocode Action

Stage 12

Simulated memory entry

get_current(simulated=True)

Stage 19

uCID review

compare sim vs real uCID chains

Stage 28

Collapse trigger on merge

enter_coma_mode()

🔐 Risk Flags

A simulated uCID evolves into conflicting behavior with real memory

Divergence between simulation echo and organic uCID chain

Merge triggers collapse unless explicitly isolated and approved

✅ Output

Conflicts are logged

System enters coma for protection

Prevents identity bleed between real and simulated chains
