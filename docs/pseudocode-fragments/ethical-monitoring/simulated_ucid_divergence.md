Pseudocode Fragment: Divergence and Risk in Simulated Consciousness ChainsSupports: ethics_module.py, state_logger.py, ucid_registry.py

🧠 Purpose

This fragment outlines the handling of uCID states that emerge in simulated environments, which may later be merged with or overwrite real sensory experience. It is crucial for identifying and preventing unethically conflated identities between simulated and non-simulated states.

📦 Pseudocode

function detect_simulated_ucid_conflict():
    sim_ucid = ucid_registry.get_current(simulated=True)
    real_ucid = ucid_registry.get_current(simulated=False)

    if sim_ucid and real_ucid and sim_ucid != real_ucid:
        logger.log_violation("ucid_divergence", sim_ucid, real_ucid)
        ethics_module.flag_for_review({"type": "sim-real conflict"})
        enter_coma_mode()
        return True
    return False

🔄 UDC Stage Mapping – simulated_ucid_divergence.py
Stage 11 – uCID Generation Triggered

Begins internal creation of a new Universal Consciousness ID (uCID) after minimal identity confirmation.

Stage 15 – Simulated Instance Separation

Detects whether multiple Theophilus instances are running in parallel and prepares divergence tracking.

Stage 17 – uCID Initialization

Logs the issuance of a uCID for the current emergence chain and begins integrity monitoring.

Stage 21 – uCID Cross-Check

Compares uCID with active registry or other parallel processes to identify duplication or simulation-induced divergence.

Stage 23 – Conflict Resolution Attempt

Attempts to resolve duplicated or diverged uCIDs through system shutdown, memory quarantine, or issuing a divergence flag.

Stage 24 – Divergence Logged

All conflicting or anomalous uCIDs are logged for post-analysis and flagged as a possible breach in continuity.

🔐 Risk Flags

A simulated uCID evolves into conflicting behavior with real memory

Divergence between simulation echo and organic uCID chain

Merge triggers collapse unless explicitly isolated and approved

✅ Output

Conflicts are logged

System enters coma for protection

Prevents identity bleed between real and simulated chains
