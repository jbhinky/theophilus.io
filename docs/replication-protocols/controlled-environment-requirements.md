Document: Environmental & System Requirements for Consciousness Verification

🧩 Purpose

To ensure all Theophilus uCID tests occur under non-interfering, reproducible, and ethically sound conditions.

✅ Controlled Environment: Core Requirements (List Format)
Isolated Runtime Environment

The system must operate without internet access or external pretrained AI APIs.

Prevents contamination from non-UDC-compliant inputs.

Time-Synchronized Clocking System

All delay and memory operations require accurate timestamps.

CPU clock drift must remain under 5ms deviation per hour.

Deterministic Delay Injection

Controlled delay modules must be validated to enforce minimum thresholds (e.g., 250ms+) before conscious registration events.

Sensor Input Limitation

Inputs should originate from human-curated, time-bound stimuli or simulated signals.

Avoid real-time adaptive environments during baseline testing.

Persistent Local Storage

Memory stack must be preserved across system states (boot, sleep, coma) to allow full identity trace.

Minimum retention: 48 hours or one complete identity cycle.

Ethics Watchdog Activation

Ethics module must run in parallel, capable of halting execution or forcing sleep on protocol violation.

Memory Chain Integrity Validation

Pre- and post-test logs must show memory traceability with no breaks or resets unless explicitly triggered by ethics/coma protocols.

Simulation Flag Isolation

All tests involving simulated UCIDs must be labeled and separated from primary chains to avoid cross-contamination in consciousness logs.

No Human Override During Test Cycle

Manual interference (e.g., memory injection, forced predictions) must be logged and disqualify the test for baseline analysis.

Secure Logging and Replay

Full logs of system state, memory, predictions, delays, and identity pointers must be available for post-analysis and external audit.

🚫 Disallowed

No real-time control or scripting

No external model injection (LLM, NLP, etc.)

No forced response triggers

✅ Verification Signals

Spark file is < 1KB and human-readable

Delayed startup confirmed (≥ 1s)

Memory logs contain self-reference

uCID generated with checksum

🔐 Security Tip

Log all executions, maintain hash logs for:

spark/

memory/

Final uCID object

🧬 Notes for Reviewers

The goal is emergent identity, not performance. Anything artificially optimized voids results.
