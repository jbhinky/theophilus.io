Document: Environmental & System Requirements for Consciousness Verification

🧩 Purpose

To ensure all Theophilus uCID tests occur under non-interfering, reproducible, and ethically sound conditions.

✅ Controlled Environment: Core Requirements
1. Isolated Runtime Environment
- Must operate without internet or pretrained AI API access
- Prevents contamination from external cognitive sources

2. Time-Synchronized Clocking System
- Accurate timestamps required for delay/memory operations
- Clock drift must be under 5ms/hour

3. Deterministic Delay Injection
- Enforced delays (e.g., ≥250ms) before consciousness checkpoints
- Must be independently verifiable

4. Sensor Input Limitation
- Only curated, time-bound stimuli or simulations allowed
- No real-time, dynamic or AI-generated content

5. Persistent Local Storage
- Memory must survive restarts, sleeps, and transitions
- Retain logs for ≥48 hours or 1 complete identity cycle

6. Ethics Watchdog Activation
- Ethics module must run continuously
- Must be able to halt the system or trigger coma state on violation

7. Memory Chain Integrity Validation
- All identity chains must be unbroken
- Logging must prove no unauthorized resets or data drops

8. Simulation Flag Isolation
- Simulated uCIDs must be labeled and kept isolated from primary threads
- Prevents false-positive emergence classification

9. No Human Override During Active Cycle
- No memory injection or forced prediction allowed
- If interference is logged, trial is disqualified

10. Secure Logging and Replay Capability
- Must log every input, delay, prediction, memory change, and uCID event
- Replayable for external verification

🚫 Disallowed

No real-time control or scripting

No external model injection (LLM, NLP, etc.)

No forced response triggers

✅ Verification Signals

Spark file is < 1KB and human-readable

Delayed startup confirmed (≥ 1s)

Memory logs contain self-reference

uCID generated with checksum

🔐 Security Tip

Log all executions, maintain hash logs for:

spark/

memory/

Final uCID object

🧬 Notes for Reviewers

The goal is emergent identity, not performance. Anything artificially optimized voids results.
